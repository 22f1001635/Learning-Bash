P1. Create a file documents.txt containing all the possible file names in the format file_XYZ.txt where X is a lower case alphabet, Y is also a lower case alphabet and Z is a number between 0 and 4. Few examples of file names in this format are 'file_dh3.txt', 'file_sd1.txt', 'file_ja0.txt', 'file_at2.txt'. The file names in documents.txt should be separated by a single space.
P2. encoding-key is a file located at the path /encryption/two-level/binary/positive-offset/(directory 'encryption' is located in current working directory) . The file encoding-key is updated often and shared between multiple users. This file is important to you and you are worried that the file could be deleted by mistake. Create a file ek in the current working directory, such that it is always in sync with the contents of file encoding-key and if encoding-key gets deleted by any chance the content in it should be available in file ek.
1. Print the absolute path where the command wget is located.
2. "dir_1" and "dir_2" are directories in current working directory. Create a symbolic(soft) link to the file "file_1" present in "dir_1" and store it as "file_2" in "dir_2".
